The "test_data.csv" file is a couple of hours of IMU data: Ax, Ay, and Az.
The files "first_half_test_data.csv" and "second_half_test_data.csv" are, as the name suggests, the first half and second half of "test_data.csv", respectively, so that they can be treated as two separate sensor data files.
If one subject is mapped to one sensor, which is used by both sensor data files, then these two files should be concatenated on export.
