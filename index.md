# Welcome to AI Sensus

AI Sensus is a development and research project that revolves around the training of AI algorithms. Ultimately, we want this platform to learn like human babies learn. 

AI Sensus manages and enhances the data collection and annotation process while training the AI. The goal of AI Sensus is to become a platform that connects any AI to the real world through any type of sensor (e.g., a microphone, video camera, or inertial measurement unit (IMU)) and facilitate the training process while collecting the data. The application synchronizes the output of various devices so that an expert can use one or more datatypes as ground truth to annotate another datatype of interest for the AI when it requires it. 

For example, show a segment of video to a human so that she can annotate the corresponding segment of IMU data. These annotations are then used by the AI to improve the performance of the given task. One of the goals is to only query an expert to annotate those samples that are most informative for training.

In it's current state the application can be used to annotate IMU time series data from various types of IMU manufacturers using off the shelf cameras.
